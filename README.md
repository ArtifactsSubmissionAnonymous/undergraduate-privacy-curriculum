# Reshaping the Privacy Mindset of Computer Science Undergraduates

>Software applications, while being an integral part of the modern world, pose significant threats to end-user privacy. Thus, computer professionals require knowledge and skills to develop software with robust privacy protection mechanisms. However, undergraduate computing degree programs often lack privacy-focused curricula that can cultivate this ability in the future workforce. Therefore, we designed a privacy curriculum informed by the common challenges that computing professionals face when developing privacy-embedded software. It guides the students in realising the need for privacy, identifying privacy protection mechanisms and programming Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). We piloted the curriculum for third-year Computer Science undergraduates at the XXX. The curriculum was evaluated using course assessments and surveys conducted before and after the lessons. According to the results, students' overall understanding of privacy improved, and they considered the lessons important and relevant to computer science undergraduates. However, they needed further improvement in recognising offline privacy threats and distinguishing between security and privacy. We also identified five learner groups based on their perceptions towards programming PETs: *capable but unengaged, moderately engaged, hands-on, perseverant and struggling*. Further, students acknowledged their responsibility for privacy protection, yet their intended commitment varied, ranging from taking minimal proactive measures to actively integrating privacy into personal projects. Based on the results, the paper suggests improvements to the curriculum.
